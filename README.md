# SourceTrace

SourceTrace is an application project for building an evidence-centric OSINT + LLM system, with research, planning, and later implementation kept in one repository.

## Current state
This repository is past the pure research-first phase and now has a bounded contract-first implementation baseline plus a first narrow runtime and delivery path.

Confirmed now:
- product direction is evidence-first and claim-centric
- research, SSOT, and execution blueprint documents are in place
- product package layout exists under `src/sourcetrace/`
- `domain` contracts are implemented
- `application` request/outcome contracts are implemented
- `application` execution seams are implemented
- lower-level retrieval and persistence seams are implemented in `pipeline.interfaces` and `storage.interfaces`
- first in-memory runtime path is implemented for persistence, lexical retrieval, and verification orchestration
- minimal analyst-facing delivery surface is implemented in `web/` as a pure-stdlib WSGI/API + HTML/Markdown baseline
- local verification baseline is `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=src pytest -q` → `119 passed`

## Repository map
- `docs/architecture/architecture-ssot.md` — canonical product and architecture baseline
- `docs/research/research-ledger.md` — rolling research notes and architecture implications
- `docs/plans/execution-blueprint-v0.md` — provisional plan between research and implementation
- `notes/` — working notes
- `src/sourcetrace/` — future application package layout
- `tests/` — package/layout and later unit/integration tests
- `data/` — local working data directories kept mostly out of git

## Working model
The intended workflow is now:
1. gather and review sources when architecture assumptions still change
2. update research ledger
3. patch SSOT and execution blueprint when assumptions change
4. execute bounded contract-first slices for agreed layers
5. only then move into runtime adapters, storage engines, and retrieval implementations

## Near-term focus
- keep repo-facing docs aligned with the delivered post-9.x baseline
- harden the minimal runtime and delivery path without broadening scope prematurely
- keep the MVP architecture small, auditable, and implementation-light until heavier runtime choices are explicit
